## Functions Exercises

### Favorite Things

* Create an array that contains a few of your favorite things (fruits, vegetables, colors, sports teams, whatever). 
* Write some code in JavaScript that outputs strings like (for an array of arbitrary length):

```
My #1 favorite thing is Dos Toros.
My #2 favorite thing is Pirates Booty.
My #3 favorite thing is Oatmeal.
``` 

###  Initials

* Define a function `initials` that takes a person's name as input and returns their initials.
* Use loops for this and don't try to use an enumerator like map.
* Use MDN if you need to look up something in the docs.

```
initials('Peter Yi-da Lai');
=> 'PYL'
```

### Air Conditioning

- Ask the user what the current temperature is, if the A/C is functional, and what temperature they wish it was.
- If the airconditioner is functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Turn on the A/C Please"
- If the airconditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is above the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C now!  It's hot!"
- If the airconditioner is non-functional and the current temperature is below the the desired temperature... display "Fix the A/C whenever you have the chance...  It's cool..."

### Guess the number

- Create a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10 inclusive.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.
